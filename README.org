#+TITLE:wood-theme
* About
  A warm, wood-tone colour theme that aims to be gentle on the eyes.

  Not sure if I can call this my design philosophy, but I have roughly followed these rules:
  + Warm wood
    - Use warm, wood-tone colour whenever possible
  + Low-saturation low-blue
    - Avoid high-saturation colours, especially blue
    - I believe this caused eye strain
  + Practical
    - break the rules if it does not work practically
    - e.g. allow blue for warning-related content

  This theme suits best to people who need to stare at the screen for long periods.
  My testimony is that this /seems/ to have fixed my eye strains.

  As of [2024-05-05 Sun], this is implemented for Emacs only.
* Installation

   :type git
   :host github
   :repo "ed9w2in6/wood-theme"

* Workflow
  + After commit, freeze all changes for at least 1 week
    - unless breaking issue
      * e.g. error (i.e. syntax), invisible char (i.e. logic)
    - annoyance (i.e. design) does NOT count as breaking
  + Record all annoyance in this document
  + Open for improvment after 1 week freeze
* Annoyances
  Nothing for now. ([2024-03-21 Thu])
* Potential Changes
  + redo with https://github.com/jasonm23/autothemer
    - benefit is that common color uses same colour name.
    - pallete generation
    - auto generation for missing component using colour distance
    - easier maintainence and customisation
      * variance definition (e.g. wood-light)
  + maybe use some orange / brown for some faces?
    - [2023-08-18 Fri] :: actually I can't pin point any that annoys me.
* Change Log
** week of [2023-08-13 Sun]
   + Better font definitions (fixed-pitch vs variable-pitch)
   + Better org mode appearance
     - These helped making =org-present= more usable (it actually look good now)
   + set ANSI colour (e.g. ugly blue for jupyter(ipython) help)
   + highlight colour (e.g. on match for isearch) should have more contrast to be easily visible
