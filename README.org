* Workflow
  + After commit, freeze all changes for at least 1 week
    - unless breaking issue
      * e.g. error (i.e. syntax), invisible char (i.e. logic)
    - annoyance (i.e. design) does NOT count as breaking
  + Record all annoyance in this document
  + Open for improvment after 1 week freeze
* Annoyances
  Nothing for now. ([2024-03-21 Thu])
* Potential Changes
  + redo with https://github.com/jasonm23/autothemer
    - benefit is that common color uses same colour name.
    - pallete generation
    - auto generation for missing component using colour distance
    - easier maintainence and customisation
      * variance definition (e.g. wood-light)
  + maybe use some orange / brown for some faces?
    - [2023-08-18 Fri] :: actually I can't pin point any that annoys me.
* Change Log
** week of [2023-08-13 Sun]
   + Better font definitions (fixed-pitch vs variable-pitch)
   + Better org mode appearance
     - These helped making =org-present= more usable (it actually look good now)
   + set ANSI colour (e.g. ugly blue for jupyter(ipython) help)
   + highlight colour (e.g. on match for isearch) should have more contrast to be easily visible
